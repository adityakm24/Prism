# Prism
 Prism is a hobby programming language compiler. It's fast, lightweight, and passes through complexities with ease âš¡.
 The compiler is written in C++ for now, but the goal is for Neutrino to become self-hosted in the future.

```
git clone <https://github.com/orosmatthew/hydrogen-cpp>
cd hydrogen-cpp
mkdir build
